His parents were Quakers and sent him, with his two brothers, to the Quaker School at Ackworth, West Yorkshire. With his schooling completed, his father placed him with a wholesaler at Tower Hill, London, as he wanted him to be involved in trade, but the position did not suit Buck, and so he looked for something else. Around 1807, the East London Waterworks Company were building Old Ford pumping station, which had been designed by Ralph Walker, and Buck managed to secure a job there.

He explained that the experiment was to make the babies resistant to HIV infection as they were (as embryos) obtained from an HIV-positive father. He specifically used a mutant gene named CCR5-\u039432 that is known to confer innate resistance to HIV.

Esteemed reviewer Robert Christgau, in MSN Music, hailed the album as a \"world-beating return to form\" for West.

version of cricket with games of only one innings each and a maximum number of overs per innings. Starting in 1963 as a knockout competition only, limited-overs cricket grew in popularity and, in 1969, a national league was created which consequently caused a reduction in the number of matches in the County Championship. The status of limited overs matches is governed by the official List A categorisation. Although many \"traditional\" cricket fans objected to the shorter form of the game, limited-overs cricket did have the advantage of delivering a result to spectators within a single day; it did improve cricket's appeal to younger or busier people; and it did prove commercially successful.\n\nThe first limited-overs international match took place at Melbourne Cricket Ground in 1971 as a time-filler after a Test match had been abandoned because of heavy rain on the opening days. It was tried simply as an experiment and to give the players some exercise, but turned out to be immensely popular. limited-overs internationals (LOIs or ODIs\u2014one-day internationals) have since grown to become a massively popular form of the game, especially for busy people who want to be able to see a whole match. The International Cricket Council reacted to this development by organising the first Cricket World Cup in England in 1975, with all the Test-playing nations taking part.", "output": "Melbourne Cricket Ground"}, "helpful": [17, 32, 25, 5, 10, 26, 36, 16, 8, 0, 2, 18, 7, 3, 29, 19, 30, 14, 12, 31, 1, 22, 35, 23, 11, 33, 13, 24, 38, 15, 37, 27, 21, 4, 6, 28, 39, 9, 20, 34], "helpful_infl": [3229.60205078125, 1750.3441162109375, 1446.4344482421875, 1369.938720703125, 1174.219482421875, 1155.7381591796875, 1126.381591796875, 962.9478149414062, 884.05419921875, 836.2543334960938, 825.3818359375, 790.8984985351562, 777.8809204101562, 768.1478881835938, 745.0921630859375, 745.0632934570312, 657.884765625, 632.3955688476562, 570.5809936523438, 550.6025390625, 539.9371337890625, 530.3446044921875, 395.80816650390625, 359.5530090332031, 354.1987609863281, 351.8268127441406, 332.09051513671875, 206.71603393554688, 185.04794311523438, 176.75567626953125, 157.98526000976562, 142.0377655029297, 133.21205139160156, 106.48147583007812, 35.32988739013672, -24.74844741821289, -128.29640197753906, -336.63616943359375, -398.98388671875, -508.6878356933594], "harmful": [34, 20, 9, 39, 28, 6, 4, 21, 27, 37, 15, 38, 24, 13, 33, 11, 23, 35, 22, 1, 31, 12, 14, 30, 19, 29, 3, 7, 18, 2, 0, 8, 16, 36, 26, 10, 5, 25, 32, 17], "harmful_infl": [-508.6878356933594, -398.98388671875, -336.63616943359375, -128.29640197753906, -24.74844741821289, 35.32988739013672, 106.48147583007812, 133.21205139160156, 142.0377655029297, 157.98526000976562, 176.75567626953125, 185.04794311523438, 206.71603393554688, 332.09051513671875, 351.8268127441406, 354.1987609863281, 359.5530090332031, 395.80816650390625, 530.3446044921875, 539.9371337890625, 550.6025390625, 570.5809936523438, 632.3955688476562, 657.884765625, 745.0632934570312, 745.0921630859375, 768.1478881835938, 777.8809204101562, 790.8984985351562, 825.3818359375, 836.2543334960938, 884.05419921875, 962.9478149414062, 1126.381591796875, 1155.7381591796875, 1174.219482421875, 1369.938720703125, 1446.4344482421875, 1750.3441162109375, 3229.60205078125]}, "14": {"test_data": {"instruction": "How long does it typically take a battery storage power station to transition to full power from standby?", "input": "A battery storage power station is a type of energy storage power station that uses a group of batteries to store electrical energy.

First released in 1985 as an extension of the C programming language, it has since expanded significantly over time; modern C++ currently has object-oriented, generic, and functional features, in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation. It is almost always implemented as a compiled language, and many vendors provide C++ compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, LLVM, Microsoft, Intel, Embarcadero, Oracle, and IBM.\n\nC++ was designed with systems programming and embedded, resource-constrained software and large systems in mind, with performance, efficiency, and flexibility of use as its design highlights. C++ has also been found useful in many other contexts, with key strengths being software infrastructure and resource-constrained applications, including desktop applications, video games, servers (e.g. e-commerce, web search, or databases), and performance-critical applications (e.g. telephone switches or space probes).\n\nC++ is standardized by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), with the latest standard version ratified and published by ISO in December 2020 as ISO/IEC 14882:2020 (informally known as C++20). The C++ programming language was initially standardized in 1998 as ISO/IEC 14882:1998, which was then amended by the C++03, C++11, C++14, and C++17 standards. The current C++20 standard supersedes these with new features and an enlarged standard library. Before the initial standardization in 1998, C++ was developed by Stroustrup at Bell Labs since 1979 as an extension of the C language; he wanted an efficient and flexible language similar to C that also provided high-level features for program organization. Since 2012, C++ has been on a three-year release schedule with C++23 as the next planned standard.", "output": "The C++ programming language was initially standardized in 1998"}, "helpful": [9, 39, 4, 20, 27, 12, 24, 19, 37, 18, 21, 36, 6, 34, 15, 14, 28, 13, 30, 7, 1, 22, 5, 35, 33, 3, 0, 38, 23, 2, 26, 11, 10, 31, 25, 8, 29, 32, 16, 17], "helpful_infl": [667.1591796875, 555.1148071289062, 544.3451538085938, 524.75537109375, 524.25537109375, 456.6446838378906, 421.4532775878906, 357.7048034667969, 316.12481689453125, 299.7821044921875, 296.2359924316406, 276.3234558105469, 187.84689331054688, 180.9310760498047, 176.5395050048828, 127.73944091796875, 125.79878234863281, 99.31033325195312, 93.49024200439453, 62.334266662597656, 2.5152835845947266, -6.4095892906188965, -62.60737609863281, -74.63990020751953, -87.69623565673828, -143.0625, -147.39382934570312, -161.57147216796875, -196.38848876953125, -209.3297882080078, -235.93019104003906, -242.54249572753906, -252.0004425048828, -257.45843505859375, -308.9488830566406, -371.3562927246094, -376.0309753417969, -627.848876953125, -690.86669921875, -881.7553100585938], "harmful": [17, 16, 32, 29, 8, 25, 31, 10, 11, 26, 2, 23, 38, 0, 3, 33, 35, 5, 22, 1, 7, 30, 13, 28, 14, 15, 34, 6, 36, 21, 18, 37, 19, 24, 12, 27, 20, 4, 39, 9], "harmful_infl": [-881.7553100585938, -690.86669921875, -627.848876953125, -376.0309753417969, -371.3562927246094, -308.9488830566406, -257.45843505859375, -252.0004425048828, -242.54249572753906, -235.93019104003906, -209.3297882080078, -196.38848876953125, -161.57147216796875, -147.39382934570312, -143.0625, -87.69623565673828, -74.63990020751953, -62.60737609863281, -6.4095892906188965, 2.5152835845947266, 62.334266662597656, 93.49024200439453, 99.31033325195312, 125.79878234863281, 127.73944091796875, 176.5395050048828, 180.9310760498047, 187.84689331054688, 276.3234558105469, 296.2359924316406, 299.7821044921875, 316.12481689453125, 357.7048034667969, 421.4532775878906, 456.6446838378906, 524.25537109375, 524.75537109375, 544.3451538085938, 555.1148071289062, 667.1591796875]}, "17": {"test_data": {"instruction": "write a linkedin informal message asking to an existing company employee for tips and guidelines for the specific role in their company.

During ownership by Metroland Publishing, a similar news style was used with common pages in both Bobcaygeon and Fenelon papers, and in the Lindsay This Week newspaper.\n\nThe paper was officially incorporated into Kawartha Lakes This Week in late 2004 in keeping with the amalgamation of Lindsay, Bobcaygeon and Fenelon Falls into the City of Kawartha Lakes.\n\nToday, back issues are available at the Bobcaygeon Public Library for viewing on Microfiche, as far back as the first issue in 1869.\n\nAlthough the paper had ceased publication in 2004, the website Amazon.com still offers subscriptions.", "output": "The Bobcaygeon Independent was established in 1869 and ceased publication in 2004."}, "helpful": [17, 5, 19, 25, 12, 36, 26, 30, 18, 32, 4, 10, 24, 14, 3, 15, 22, 7, 1, 9, 0, 37, 27, 8, 2, 21, 39, 13, 35, 31, 11, 28, 29, 33, 38, 6, 16, 20, 34, 23], "helpful_infl": [4824.64013671875, 2962.19287109375, 2254.45751953125, 2194.269287109375, 2013.0487060546875, 1866.174560546875, 1847.314697265625, 1827.3040771484375, 1701.639892578125, 1679.567626953125, 1617.42333984375, 1549.75634765625, 1538.81396484375, 1481.705322265625, 1166.9248046875, 1151.96337890625, 1146.458740234375, 1132.466552734375, 1124.839111328125, 1114.4415283203125, 1085.414306640625, 1064.1920166015625, 1057.73046875, 1030.2486572265625, 963.3748779296875, 909.03466796875, 848.9276123046875, 698.4266357421875, 429.9479675292969, 345.52484130859375, 309.2113037109375, 258.6448669433594, 254.53439331054688, 209.1038055419922, -44.63786315917969, -112.64907836914062, -164.97799682617188, -533.9400634765625, -1106.7225341796875, -1424.534423828125], "harmful": [23, 34, 20, 16, 6, 38, 33, 29, 28, 11, 31, 35, 13, 39, 21, 2, 8, 27, 37, 0, 9, 1, 7, 22, 15, 3, 14, 24, 10, 4, 32, 18, 30, 26, 36, 12, 25, 19, 5, 17], "harmful_infl": [-1424.534423828125, -1106.7225341796875, -533.9400634765625, -164.97799682617188, -112.64907836914062, -44.63786315917969, 209.1038055419922, 254.53439331054688, 258.6448669433594, 309.2113037109375, 345.52484130859375, 429.9479675292969, 698.4266357421875, 848.9276123046875, 909.03466796875, 963.3748779296875, 1030.2486572265625, 1057.73046875, 1064.1920166015625, 1085.414306640625, 1114.4415283203125, 1124.839111328125, 1132.466552734375, 1146.458740234375, 1151.96337890625, 1166.9248046875, 1481.705322265625, 1538.81396484375, 1549.75634765625, 1617.42333984375, 1679.567626953125, 1701.639892578125, 1827.3040771484375, 1847.314697265625, 1866.174560546875, 2013.0487060546875, 2194.269287109375, 2254.45751953125, 2962.19287109375, 4824.64013671875]}, "28": {"test_data": {"instruction": "What is the best boba order to place from a local boba store for a company that has around 300 employees in the office?", "input": "", "output": "In order to serve up to 300 people, it's best to order a couple of different tea flavors to fit everyone's taste.

To simultaneously enforce memory safety and prevent concurrent data races, Rust's \"borrow checker\" tracks the object lifetime of all references in a program during compilation. Rust is popular for systems programming but also offers high-level features including some functional programming constructs."}, "helpful": [23, 16, 28, 20, 34, 29, 32, 6, 0, 31, 38, 25, 7, 13, 8, 35, 11, 3, 10, 22, 39, 33, 1, 21, 2, 36, 26, 14, 37, 30, 27, 17, 24, 18, 15, 4, 9, 12, 19, 5], "helpful_infl": [317.8735046386719, 189.23178100585938, 125.26539611816406, 111.91643524169922, 97.76773071289062, 91.44033813476562, 87.50752258300781, 58.403968811035156, 57.27538299560547, 51.7454948425293, 51.629913330078125, 49.5537223815918, 47.79920959472656, 38.14457321166992, 37.700496673583984, 35.31924819946289, 34.38637161254883, 28.2864990234375, 28.00391387939453, 23.16390609741211, 20.527088165283203, 15.123427391052246, -3.2951407432556152, -6.903026580810547, -17.563858032226562, -19.49795150756836, -39.840152740478516, -71.05886840820312, -72.96797180175781, -77.90038299560547, -80.23362731933594, -88.81199645996094, -98.66871643066406, -107.4698257446289, -107.55247497558594, -110.06392669677734, -116.69309997558594, -118.2437515258789, -135.738037109375, -137.3351593017578], "harmful": [5, 19, 12, 9, 4, 15, 18, 24, 17, 27, 30, 37, 14, 26, 36, 2, 21, 1, 33, 39, 22, 10, 3, 11, 35, 8, 13, 7, 25, 38, 31, 0, 6, 32, 29, 34, 20, 28, 16, 23], "harmful_infl": [-137.3351593017578, -135.738037109375, -118.2437515258789, -116.69309997558594, -110.06392669677734, -107.55247497558594, -107.4698257446289, -98.66871643066406, -88.81199645996094, -80.23362731933594, -77.90038299560547, -72.96797180175781, -71.05886840820312, -39.840152740478516, -19.49795150756836, -17.563858032226562, -6.903026580810547, -3.2951407432556152, 15.123427391052246, 20.527088165283203, 23.16390609741211, 28.00391387939453, 28.2864990234375, 34.38637161254883, 35.31924819946289, 37.700496673583984, 38.14457321166992, 47.79920959472656, 49.5537223815918, 51.629913330078125, 51.7454948425293, 57.27538299560547, 58.403968811035156, 87.50752258300781, 91.44033813476562, 97.76773071289062, 111.91643524169922, 125.26539611816406, 189.23178100585938, 317.8735046386719]}, "32": {"test_data": {"instruction": "What is data warehousing?", "input": "In computing, a data warehouse (DW or DWH), also known as an enterprise data warehouse (EDW), is a system used for reporting and data analysis and is considered a core component of business intelligence.

They have smooth tires with tread patterns and engines generally in the 125 cc (7.6 cu in) and over range. Typically, street motorcycles are capable of speeds up to 100 mph (160 km/h), and many of speeds in excess of 125 mph (201 km/h).

{"instruction": "What is the relationship between Link and Zelda?", "input": "Link is a fictional character and the protagonist of Nintendo's video game franchise The Legend of Zelda. He was created by Japanese video game designer Shigeru Miyamoto. Link was introduced as the hero of the original 1986 The Legend of Zelda video game and has appeared in a total of 19 entries in the series, as well as a number of spin-offs. Common elements in the series include Link travelling through Hyrule whilst exploring dungeons, battling creatures and solving puzzles until he eventually defeats the series' primary antagonist, Ganon, and saves Princess Zelda.\n\nThroughout The Legend of Zelda series, Link has made multiple appearances in a variety of incarnations. He has been rendered in both 2D and 3D form and has been traditionally depicted in his signature green cap and tunic carrying a sword and shield. Over the course of the series, he appears as a child or young adult of the Hylian race, which originates from the fictional kingdom of Hyrule. Within Zelda lore, Link is the soul of a legendary hero that throughout history is reincarnated within a seemingly ordinary boy or man when the need arises for a new warrior to defeat the forces of evil. To defeat Ganon, Link usually obtains the mystical Master Sword or a similar legendary weapon, which is obtained after completing various trials. Over the course of his journey, he also acquires other magical items, including musical instruments and other weaponry.\n\nIn addition to the main series, Link has appeared in other Nintendo media, including merchandise, comics and manga, and an animated television series. He is a prominent character in various spin-off games, including Hyrule Warriors, Cadence of Hyrule and Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity. He has appeared in entries of several other game franchises, including the Super Smash Bros. series, SoulCalibur II and Mario Kart 8, and has also been referenced in other games, such as The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim.\n\nAlongside fellow Nintendo character Mario, Link is one of the most recognisable characters in the video game industry. He has been instrumental in the establishment of the role-playing video game genre as the protagonist of the series, which has influenced numerous other video games with its concepts of open world and nonlinear gameplay. According to Guinness World Records, Link is the most critically acclaimed videogame playable character and the most ubiquitous action-adventure video game character, surpassing Mario. He has been recognised by the Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition as the second best video game character of all time after Mario. Critics have also named him as one of the most influential video game characters of all time and one of Shigeru Miyamoto's most famous creations.\n\nLink is a brave, skilled warrior and the hero of The Legend of Zelda series. Over the course of the series, he has appeared in a variety of ages and forms, ranging from child to young adult, and in Twilight Princess, also appears in the form of a wolf. He displays the characteristic traits of the Hylian race, being of human form with elfin features, including pointed ears. Since the original 1986 The Legend of Zelda video game, he has been repeatedly depicted wearing his characteristic green cap and tunic. He has also appeared wearing other outfits, including a blue lobster shirt in The Wind Waker and his blue Champion's Tunic in Breath of the Wild. Link is described in the original game's instruction manual as a \"young lad\" and a traveller and in later games, such as Breath of the Wild, as a knight of Hyrule who is sworn to protect the kingdom and Princess Zelda. During gameplay, he carries a sword and a shield, but has also wielded a variety of other weapons, including bows, spears and axes.\n\nLink's signature weapon is the Master Sword, a powerful magic sword that has the ability to repel evil. He is also often depicted holding the Hylian Shield. These two components have become integral aspects of the character's identity. Each game in the series follows a similar story arc in which Link must take a journey that eventually leads him to recover the Master Sword, which makes him stronger in gameplay and enables him to defeat the series' main antagonist, Ganon.\n\nThroughout each game, Link is able to obtain various items during his adventures, which the player can then use in gameplay. Many of these objects possess magical properties that bestow specific abilities on Link, such as a magic cape that makes Link invisible when he wears it, or potions that replenish his health. Others have various practical purposes, such as the hookshot, which enables Link to pull items towards him, and bombs for detonation. Link has used various musical instruments on his travels, most notably, the Ocarina of Time, which when played is used for teleportation. In Breath of the Wild, Link's key tool is the Sheikah Slate, a handheld tablet featuring various runes that enable him to manipulate the game world.\n\nIn Zelda lore, Link is the reincarnated soul of a hero, chosen by the goddess Hylia to protect the kingdom of Hyrule from Ganon and save Princess Zelda whenever the need arises. As the goddess' chosen hero, he is also the bearer of the Triforce of Courage, one of the three components that combine to form the Triforce, a sacred artefact and symbol of power. In several Zelda games, Link's main objective is to recover the fragments of the Triforce in order to defeat Ganon. Link's character is always depicted as a fearless hero and a \"symbol of courage\" who is willing to protect Hyrule for the sake of others.\n\nRelationships\nLink's relationships with the other main characters has been a defining aspect of the series. Within the fictional lore, Ganon, Zelda and Link represent three pieces of the Triforce, with Ganon representing Power, Zelda representing Wisdom and Link representing Courage. This trinity transcends the fictional timeline and dictates that the three characters are destined to be forever reincarnated in an endless battle for good and evil. Link's battle with Ganon established a fictional chronology that spans across the entire series and branches into three separate timelines. The three timelines originate at the end of Ocarina of Time when the timeline splits according to whether Link successfully defeats Ganon (\"The Hero is Victorious\") or fails to stop him (the \"Fallen Hero\" timeline). The official fictional chronology was revealed in Hyrule Historia, with Skyward Sword presented as the first game in the timeline. Skyward Sword establishes that the three main characters are destined to be connected in an endless cycle after the antagonist Demise curses Link and Zelda.\n\nLink's relationship with Zelda has been a core aspect of the series but has also been the subject of speculation. Throughout the games, the storylines have suggested the possibility of a romantic relationship between the two, but this has remained ambiguous. With each game release, the nature of their relationship has varied and Link has also been presented with other possible love interests. A romantic relationship between Link and Zelda is particularly evident in Skyward Sword and was also emphasised in an official \"romance trailer\" for the game. Aonuma commented on this relationship in an interview with Game Informer: \"As far as the love story goes, it wasn't that we wanted to create a romance between Link and Zelda as much as we wanted the player to feel like this is a person who's very important to me, who I need to find. We used that hint of a romance between the two to tug at the heartstrings\". In Breath of the Wild, the relationship between Link and Zelda is more complex and follows a story arc that begins with resentment and ends in a close bond with each willing to give their life for the other.", "output": "Link's relationship with Zelda has been developing as the story flows. In lore, Link, Zelda, and Ganon (the evil) represent three pieces Triforce, corresponding to Courage, Wisdom, and Power, respectively. The three are destined connected in an endless cycle.\nPeople speculate that Link and Zelda are in a possible romantic relationship.

It was initially held at the Champ de Mars, and was transferred to Longchamp in 1857. It was cancelled due to the Franco-Prussian War in 1871, and was renamed the Grande Poule des Produits in 1872.\n\nThe race was one of several trials for the Prix du Jockey Club collectively known as the Poules des Produits. The others (listed by their modern titles) were the Prix Daru, the Prix Hocquart, the Prix Noailles and the Prix Greffulhe. Unlike those races, the Grande Poule des Produits had no restrictions based on the nationality of a horse's sire or dam.\n\nThe event was renamed in memory of Auguste Lupin (1807\u20131895), a successful owner-breeder, in 1896.\n\nThe Prix Lupin was abandoned throughout World War I, with no running from 1915 to 1918.

He is best remembered for the remark he wrote in a letter to an Anglican bishop in 1887: \n\n\"Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. Great men are almost always bad men\u2026\"\n\nIn 1870, along with his mentor D\u00f6llinger, Acton opposed the moves to promulgate the doctrine of papal infallibility in the First Vatican Council, travelling to Rome to lobby against it, ultimately unsuccessfully. Unlike D\u00f6llinger, Acton did not become an Old Catholic, and continued attending Mass regularly; he received the last rites on his deathbed. The Catholic Church did not try to force his hand. It was in this context that, in a letter he wrote to scholar and ecclesiastic Mandell Creighton, dated April 1887, Acton made his most famous pronouncement:\n\nBut if we might discuss this point until we found that we nearly agreed, and if we do agree thoroughly about the impropriety of Carlylese denunciations and Pharisaism in history, I cannot accept your canon that we are to judge Pope and King unlike other men, with a favourable presumption that they did no wrong. If there is any presumption it is the other way, against the holders of power, increasing as the power increases. Historic responsibility has to make up for the want of legal responsibility. Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. Great men are almost always bad men, even when they exercise influence and not authority, still more when you superadd the tendency or the certainty of corruption by authority. There is no worse heresy than that the office sanctifies the holder of it. That is the point at which the negation of Catholicism and the negation of Liberalism meet and keep high festival, and the end learns to justify the means. You would hang a man of no position like Ravaillac; but if what one hears is true, then Elizabeth asked the gaoler to murder Mary, and William III of England ordered his Scots minister to extirpate a clan. Here are the greatest names coupled with the greatest crimes; you would spare those criminals, for some mysterious reason. I would hang them higher than Haman, for reasons of quite obvious justice, still more, still higher for the sake of historical science.\n\nThenceforth he steered clear of theological polemics. He devoted himself to reading, study and congenial society. With all his capacity for study, he was a man of the world and a man of affairs, not a bookworm. His only notable publications were a masterly essay in the Quarterly Review of January 1878 on \"Democracy in Europe;\" two lectures delivered at Bridgnorth in 1877 on \"The History of Freedom in Antiquity\" and \"The History of Freedom in Christianity\"\u2014these last the only tangible portions put together by him of his long-projected \"History of Liberty;\" and an essay on modern German historians in the first number of the English Historical Review, which he helped to found (1886). After 1879 he divided his time between London, Cannes, and Tegernsee in Bavaria, enjoying and reciprocating the society of his friends. In 1872 he had been given the honorary degree of Doctor of Philosophy by the University of Munich; in 1888 Cambridge gave him the honorary degree of Doctor of Laws, and in 1889 Oxford the Doctor of Civil Law; and in 1890 he received the high academic accolade of being made a fellow of All Souls College, Oxford.", "output": "In a letter to Mandell Creighton, John Dalberg-Acton made his most famous pronouncement: \"Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.

Examples of this could include drilling for resources under Federal land or when drilling in highly populated areas.

Later on, the Gracie family developed their own self-defense system, and published Gracie Jiu-Jitsu.\n\nBJJ eventually came to be its own defined combat sport through the innovations, practices, and adaptation of Gracie jiu-jitsu and Judo, and became an essential martial art for modern MMA. Governing bodies such as the IBJJF work worldwide, and set the rules and standards to be held in sport BJJ competitions.\n\nBJJ revolves around the concept, taken from traditional Japanese j\u016bjutsu, that a smaller, weaker person can successfully defend themselves against a bigger, stronger, heavier opponent by using leverage and weight distribution, taking the fight to the ground and using a number of holds and submissions to defeat them. BJJ training can be used for sport grappling and self-defense situations.

Each microphone technology was developed for a certain kind of environment.\n\nCondenser microphones like the Blue Yeti are designed to record their entire environment with the utmost clarity. If your environment is noisy then the microphone audio will be noisy. But if the environment has been acoustically treated then the recording will sound detailed and clear. \n\nDynamic microphones like the Shure SM7B are designed to record sounds spoken within a 18 inches of the front of the microphone. All other sounds will be quieter and less detailed. If the environment is noisy then the microphone audio will tend to mute out sound that comes from off-axis. If the environment is quiet then the audio will sound good, but only if the person or instrument being recorded is within 18 inches of the microphone.\n\nA ribbon microphone is designed to capture extremely loud percussion sounds, usually from drums or brass instruments. They are not suitable for recording human voices as they tend to emphasize frequencies not usually associated with the human voice."}, "helpful": [39, 20, 9, 28, 27, 4, 34, 21, 24, 6, 36, 19, 12, 7, 18, 23, 37, 15, 13, 30, 1, 22, 38, 33, 11, 35, 14, 0, 10, 5, 3, 31, 2, 8, 29, 26, 25, 16, 32, 17], "helpful_infl": [572.1815185546875, 464.709228515625, 437.8288879394531, 351.6772155761719, 297.06536865234375, 256.9130859375, 238.10313415527344, 230.28192138671875, 215.881103515625, 159.46263122558594, 148.11056518554688, 113.72323608398438, 110.11155700683594, 91.24231719970703, 85.32637023925781, 64.47186279296875, 60.63161087036133, 2.2286534309387207, -0.4188270568847656, -3.2278385162353516, -9.392202377319336, -29.419401168823242, -41.456974029541016, -81.88573455810547, -85.00688171386719, -91.44556427001953, -98.90750122070312, -113.7396240234375, -116.74283599853516, -126.56495666503906, -132.44601440429688, -141.74560546875, -170.98497009277344, -231.77740478515625, -250.14675903320312, -251.00698852539062, -252.9358673095703, -372.53814697265625, -452.8476257324219, -708.1075439453125], "harmful": [17, 32, 16, 25, 26, 29, 8, 2, 31, 3, 5, 10, 0, 14, 35, 11, 33, 38, 22, 1, 30, 13, 15, 37, 23, 18, 7, 12, 19, 36, 6, 24, 21, 34, 4, 27, 28, 9, 20, 39], "harmful_infl": [-708.1075439453125, -452.8476257324219, -372.53814697265625, -252.9358673095703, -251.00698852539062, -250.14675903320312, -231.77740478515625, -170.98497009277344, -141.74560546875, -132.44601440429688, -126.56495666503906, -116.74283599853516, -113.7396240234375, -98.90750122070312, -91.44556427001953, -85.00688171386719, -81.88573455810547, -41.456974029541016, -29.419401168823242, -9.392202377319336, -3.2278385162353516, -0.4188270568847656, 2.2286534309387207, 60.63161087036133, 64.47186279296875, 85.32637023925781, 91.24231719970703, 110.11155700683594, 113.72323608398438, 148.11056518554688, 159.46263122558594, 215.881103515625, 230.28192138671875, 238.10313415527344, 256.9130859375, 297.06536865234375, 351.6772155761719, 437.8288879394531, 464.709228515625, 572.1815185546875]}, "70": {"test_data": {"instruction": "Given this paragraph about the tour de france, how many riders are in the tour", "input": "There are usually between 20 and 22 teams, with eight riders in each.

Essentially, someone with high EQ is very aware of how they are perceived, but just as importantly, they have an innate ability to discern others' feelings and motivations. Leaders with high EQ are interested in learning about what makes their employees tick, and they are aware that many people have completely different motivations. For example, a manager with high EQ understands that even though they may not personally be motivated primarily by receiving positive feedback, that if someone on their team becomes extremely motivated by praise for a job well done, they must make sure they are regularly delivering the kudos that employee thrives on.  In the past, there was a lot of focus on IQ, and while that can be a quality of a good manager, it is often more of the 'intangibles' of EQ and other personality traits that define an inspirational leader."}, "helpful": [17, 19, 5, 12, 25, 4, 26, 36, 15, 18, 14, 9, 27, 30, 37, 24, 32, 0, 7, 21, 22, 2, 1, 10, 39, 13, 3, 8, 35, 33, 31, 11, 28, 38, 6, 29, 20, 16, 34, 23], "helpful_infl": [712.8118286132812, 569.0023803710938, 560.3474731445312, 456.3783874511719, 416.85198974609375, 379.9813537597656, 362.9405212402344, 361.8054504394531, 353.8009338378906, 345.69451904296875, 339.7101135253906, 313.75604248046875, 308.5654296875, 301.72344970703125, 227.47035217285156, 227.17276000976562, 184.9573974609375, 170.57861328125, 169.88670349121094, 159.73733520507812, 156.5843963623047, 140.90139770507812, 131.726806640625, 129.40081787109375, 128.64279174804688, 103.02152252197266, 102.2535171508789, 71.07545471191406, 59.569313049316406, 15.533945083618164, 12.527288436889648, -4.531671524047852, -18.24435806274414, -30.237274169921875, -41.317596435546875, -86.38301086425781, -176.4610595703125, -228.94117736816406, -270.0247802734375, -625.3390502929688], "harmful": [23, 34, 16, 20, 29, 6, 38, 28, 11, 31, 33, 35, 8, 3, 13, 39, 10, 1, 2, 22, 21, 7, 0, 32, 24, 37, 30, 27, 9, 14, 18, 15, 36, 26, 4, 25, 12, 5, 19, 17], "harmful_infl": [-625.3390502929688, -270.0247802734375, -228.94117736816406, -176.4610595703125, -86.38301086425781, -41.317596435546875, -30.237274169921875, -18.24435806274414, -4.531671524047852, 12.527288436889648, 15.533945083618164, 59.569313049316406, 71.07545471191406, 102.2535171508789, 103.02152252197266, 128.64279174804688, 129.40081787109375, 131.726806640625, 140.90139770507812, 156.5843963623047, 159.73733520507812, 169.88670349121094, 170.57861328125, 184.9573974609375, 227.17276000976562, 227.47035217285156, 301.72344970703125, 308.5654296875, 313.75604248046875, 339.7101135253906, 345.69451904296875, 353.8009338378906, 361.8054504394531, 362.9405212402344, 379.9813537597656, 416.85198974609375, 456.3783874511719, 560.3474731445312, 569.0023803710938, 712.8118286132812]}, "72": {"test_data": {"instruction": "What are the healthiest cooking methods for preparing meals?", "input": "", "output": "Steaming - cooking food by exposing retains nutrients and flavor.\nBoiling - A healthy cooking method but boiling for too long causes the loss of some nutrients.\nGrilling - cooking food over an open flame allows surplus fat to drip from the food.\nBaking and roasting - involve cooking in an oven, which can retain nutrients and flavors.\nStir-frying - A healthy method of cooking food in high heat.\nPoaching - involves cooking food in liquid at a low temperature.\nThe healthiest cooking methods involve minimal added fats, salt, and sugar."}, "helpful": [17, 32, 25, 5, 26, 18, 14, 22, 10, 36, 8, 0, 19, 12, 30, 7, 2, 3, 1, 29, 4, 37, 13, 27, 31, 11, 16, 15, 35, 21, 24, 38, 33, 6, 9, 39, 28, 23, 34, 20], "helpful_infl": [938.975341796875, 547.25244140625, 514.5357666015625, 449.9553527832031, 444.15484619140625, 332.9089050292969, 330.8456115722656, 304.591064453125, 302.1084289550781, 299.76849365234375, 290.3727722167969, 288.90802001953125, 288.5852966308594, 267.2652587890625, 263.09552001953125, 262.3571472167969, 255.780517578125, 237.54241943359375, 234.97998046875, 209.93563842773438, 189.17308044433594, 161.7272491455078, 159.12298583984375, 144.8806915283203, 134.11575317382812, 126.09046173095703, 123.85131072998047, 121.3066177368164, 119.18518829345703, 102.9049072265625, 99.95410919189453, 99.24787139892578, 55.649024963378906, 48.57452392578125, 24.702606201171875, 24.452980041503906, -13.03747844696045, -97.63688659667969, -186.14749145507812, -239.7655029296875], "harmful": [20, 34, 23, 28, 39, 9, 6, 33, 38, 24, 21, 35, 15, 16, 11, 31, 27, 13, 37, 4, 29, 1, 3, 2, 7, 30, 12, 19, 0, 8, 36, 10, 22, 14, 18, 26, 5, 25, 32, 17], "harmful_infl": [-239.7655029296875, -186.14749145507812, -97.63688659667969, -13.03747844696045, 24.452980041503906, 24.702606201171875, 48.57452392578125, 55.649024963378906, 99.24787139892578, 99.95410919189453, 102.9049072265625, 119.18518829345703, 121.3066177368164, 123.85131072998047, 126.09046173095703, 134.11575317382812, 144.8806915283203, 159.12298583984375, 161.7272491455078, 189.17308044433594, 209.93563842773438, 234.97998046875, 237.54241943359375, 255.780517578125, 262.3571472167969, 263.09552001953125, 267.2652587890625, 288.5852966308594, 288.90802001953125, 290.3727722167969, 299.76849365234375, 302.1084289550781, 304.591064453125, 330.8456115722656, 332.9089050292969, 444.15484619140625, 449.9553527832031, 514.5357666015625, 547.25244140625, 938.975341796875]}, "73": {"test_data": {"instruction": "Please extract the names of the 1990s films Adam Sandler was in separating them with commas.", "input": "In 1993, Adam Sandler appeared in the film Coneheads with Farley, David Spade, Dan Aykroyd, Phil Hartman, and Jane Curtin.

Jiang was paramount leader of China from 1989 to 2002. He was the core leader of the third generation of Chinese leadership, one of four core leaders alongside Mao Zedong, Deng Xiaoping and Xi Jinping.\n\nBorn in Yangzhou, Jiangsu, Jiang joined the CCP while he was in college. After the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, he received training at the Stalin Automobile Works in Moscow in the 1950s, later returning to Shanghai in 1962 to serve in various institutes, later being sent between 1970-1972 to Romania as part of an expert team to establish machinery manufacturing plants in the country. After 1979, he was appointed as the vice chair of two commissions by vice premier Gu Mu to oversee the newly-established special economic zones (SEZs). He became the vice minister of the newly-established Ministry of Electronics Industry and a member of the CCP Central Committee in 1982.\n\nJiang was appointed as the mayor of Shanghai in 1985, later being promoted to its Communist Party secretary, as well as a member of the CCP Politburo, in 1987. Jiang came to power unexpectedly as a compromise candidate following the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre, when he replaced Zhao Ziyang as CCP general secretary after Zhao was ousted for his support for the student movement. As the involvement of the \"Eight Elders\" in Chinese politics steadily declined, Jiang consolidated his hold on power to become the \"paramount leader\" in the country during the 1990s. Urged by Deng Xiaoping's southern tour in 1992, Jiang officially introduced the term \"socialist market economy\" in his speech during the 14th CCP National Congress held later that year, which accelerated \"opening up and reform\".\n\nUnder Jiang's leadership, China experienced substantial economic growth with the continuation of market reforms. The returning of Hong Kong from the United Kingdom in 1997 and of Macau from Portugal in 1999, and entry into the World Trade Organisation in 2001, were landmark moments of his era. China also witnessed improved relations with the outside world, while the Communist Party maintained its tight control over the state. Jiang faced criticism over human rights abuses, including the crackdown on the Falun Gong movement. His contributions to party doctrine, known as the \"Three Represents\", were written into the CCP constitution in 2002. Jiang gradually vacated his official leadership titles from 2002 to 2005, being succeeded in these roles by Hu Jintao, although he and his political faction continued to influence affairs until much later.

Using cellphone too much would take too much of your time, and you would spend less time reading books, doing exercises, playing outside, talking to people, which harms your overall development. Adults like me already ready lots of books, did lots of exercises, and talked to a lot of people when I was a teenager, so I already developed those skills.\n3.

That would make Cristiano Ronaldo the top player in the world, with his all-time record of more than 800 goals for club and country. Right behind him is his rival Lionel Messi, who also has collected far more assists than his Portuguese counterpart. Young striker Erling Haaland may have something to say about that, however, as his incredible start to the Premier League season has seen him on pace to shatter the league's single-season goalscoring record.\n\nHowever, that seems to discount those who play other positions, like 2018 Ballon d'Or winner Luka Modric, whose midfield brilliance led Croatia to the last World Cup final, or 2022 Yashin trophy winner Thibaut Courtois, whose goalkeeping heroics earned him Man of the Match in the 2022 Champions League final."}, "helpful": [12, 9, 19, 4, 5, 18, 30, 27, 17, 14, 15, 39, 37, 26, 21, 36, 24, 1, 22, 25, 28, 13, 7, 3, 2, 0, 6, 8, 38, 10, 11, 33, 35, 31, 34, 29, 32, 20, 16, 23], "helpful_infl": [642.2720947265625, 568.3809204101562, 564.5396118164062, 535.98876953125, 496.7335510253906, 472.5706787109375, 438.52984619140625, 431.1253356933594, 383.85247802734375, 360.3963623046875, 349.9223327636719, 293.51885986328125, 286.960693359375, 272.77545166015625, 272.2059631347656, 253.7086181640625, 252.0715789794922, 217.60446166992188, 206.7678985595703, 204.6831512451172, 176.95523071289062, 164.58404541015625, 161.8624267578125, 159.0237274169922, 157.72433471679688, 146.12770080566406, 82.86937713623047, 29.997486114501953, 23.076141357421875, 4.429080009460449, -1.8423385620117188, -4.885534286499023, -17.106843948364258, -68.02177429199219, -116.22757720947266, -164.32528686523438, -166.168701171875, -450.58709716796875, -561.5753784179688, -565.6405639648438], "harmful": [23, 16, 20, 32, 29, 34, 31, 35, 33, 11, 10, 38, 8, 6, 0, 2, 3, 7, 13, 28, 25, 22, 1, 24, 36, 21, 26, 37, 39, 15, 14, 17, 27, 30, 18, 5, 4, 19, 9, 12], "harmful_infl": [-565.6405639648438, -561.5753784179688, -450.58709716796875, -166.168701171875, -164.32528686523438, -116.22757720947266, -68.02177429199219, -17.106843948364258, -4.885534286499023, -1.8423385620117188, 4.429080009460449, 23.076141357421875, 29.997486114501953, 82.86937713623047, 146.12770080566406, 157.72433471679688, 159.0237274169922, 161.8624267578125, 164.58404541015625, 176.95523071289062, 204.6831512451172, 206.7678985595703, 217.60446166992188, 252.0715789794922, 253.7086181640625, 272.2059631347656, 272.77545166015625, 286.960693359375, 293.51885986328125, 349.9223327636719, 360.3963623046875, 383.85247802734375, 431.1253356933594, 438.52984619140625, 472.5706787109375, 496.7335510253906, 535.98876953125, 564.5396118164062, 568.3809204101562, 642.2720947265625]}, "102": {"test_data": {"instruction": "Given this mechanism that the Tesla Model Y car uses to heat the interior cabin, what are some pros and cons of this design?", "input": "The Model Y is Tesla's first car to use a heat pump instead of electric resistance for interior cabin heating.

Blacha). He also writes the music, and is the main performer for the virtual melodic death metal band Dethklok, which began as the subject of Metalocalypse but has taken on a life of its own, with four albums and an occasional live touring band, headed by Small. Small has also released two albums under his own name, in a similar musical style to Dethklok.\n\nSmall was born in Illinois in 1975. He moved to California as a child. Small started learning guitar at the age of 14 after a kid in his neighborhood began teaching him about guitar and music. At his first public performance, his hands shook so wildly that he had trouble controlling the guitar. It would be another ten years before he was comfortable performing in public. He graduated from Palma High School in Salinas, California. He graduated from Berklee College of Music in 1997. During his music studies, he took several writing and comedy classes at Emerson College. After graduating, he felt that the rock music genre was fading in popularity, so decided to try his hand at stand-up comedy.", "output": "Brendon Small is a  stand-up comedian, Creator of TV shows and
